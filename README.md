😎😎 ### Project Name: CallInsight 😎😎

🙌🙌 ### Tagline: Empowering Customer Interactions with AI-Driven Insights 🙌🙌

* * * * *

### Overview and Introduction 🧐🧐🧐

The Call Insight Project is an innovative solution designed to streamline the analysis and management of business-related communication within organizations. It leverages AI-powered technologies to provide deeper insights into employee call activities, improve performance monitoring, and enhance customer satisfaction tracking, all in real-time.

* * * * *

### Why Are We Making This? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

In modern organizations, managing and analyzing employee communication, especially through calls, can be a daunting and inefficient task. Manual tracking of call purposes, outcomes, and quality often leads to errors and inconsistencies. Without an effective system, organizations face several challenges:

-   Tracking Employee Activities:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Monitoring each employee's calls, purposes, and context can be time-consuming and error-prone. This lack of visibility often results in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for improvement.

-   Customer Satisfaction Monitoring:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Understanding customer satisfaction levels during calls is crucial for maintaining strong client relationships. Manually evaluating this is not scalable for larger teams.

-   Call Remarks Management:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Recording call remarks such as the reason for the call, customer responses, and follow-up actions are often inconsistent, leading to incomplete data.

-   Performance Assessment:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Evaluating employee performance based on call data is difficult without structured information. Without a system, identifying areas for improvement is more guesswork than analysis.

-   Detecting Fake Calls:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Identifying fake calls used to inflate performance metrics is near impossible without a comprehensive monitoring system.

-   Sentiment and Context Analysis:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Traditional methods fail to capture and analyze customer sentiments or the context behind calls. Our AI-powered solution automatically extracts these insights, offering a richer understanding.

-   Streamlining Managerial Oversight:\ 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♂️
    Managers need real-time data and actionable insights into employee communication activities to supervise large teams effectively. Without this, oversight becomes challenging.

#### Phase 2: Web Dashboard 🧑🧑🧑

The second phase introduces a robust web dashboard for employees, managers, and admins, each with specific roles and functionalities:

-   Employee Role:\
    Employees can view and analyze their own communication data, including call records filtered by parameters like date, type, and more.

-   Manager Role:\
    Managers have access to the communication data of their team, allowing them to monitor productivity, assess performance, and track workload distribution.

-   Admin Role:\
    Admins oversee the entire system, managing user registrations, role assignments, and account maintenance. They ensure the system remains secure and up-to-date.

-   Key Features:

-   Role-based access to data with granular permissions.

How to Set Up the Call Insight Project 🚀🚀🚀
--------------------------------------

Follow the steps below to set up both the frontend and backend systems for the Call Insight project:

* * * * *

### Prerequisites ⚓⚓⚓

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Node.js (Recommended version: 16 or higher)

-   npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

-   Any IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

* * * * *

### Step 1: Setting Up the Frontend ⚓⚓⚓

#### Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

Open your terminal and change the directory to the frontend folder:

```
cd path/to/frontend
```

#### Add the .env File:

Create and place a .env file in the root of the frontend directory. This file will contain essential environment variables required for the frontend to function properly (e.g., API endpoints, third-party service keys, etc.).

#### Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install all the necessary packages defined in the package.json file:

```
npm install
```

This will download and set up all required dependencies for the frontend.

* * * * *

### Step 2: Setting Up the Backend ⚓⚓⚓

#### Navigate to the Backend Directory:

In your terminal, change the directory to the backend folder:

```
cd path/to/backend
```

#### Add the .env File:

Similarly, place a .env file in the root of the backend directory. This file will contain critical configuration details such as database credentials, server settings, and API keys.

#### Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install the necessary backend dependencies:

```
npm install
```

This will set up the required packages for the backend as per the package.json file.

* * * * *

### Step 3: Starting the Servers ⚓⚓⚓

#### Start the Backend Server:

In the backend directory, use the following command to start the backend server:

```
npm run start
```

You should see a message indicating that the backend server is running successfully.

#### Start the Frontend Server:

After the backend server is running, open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend server in development mode, typically accessible at[  http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

* * * * *

### Additional Notes 🧿🧿🧿

-   Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the project to function correctly.

-   If you encounter issues, check the console logs for error messages, and ensure all environment variables in the .env files are correctly configured.

-   The frontend and backend ports can be customized in their respective .env files, but they must match the configuration defined in the project for seamless communication.
